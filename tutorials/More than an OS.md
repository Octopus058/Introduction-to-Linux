## All good must come to an end
At this point, this tutorial is over. If you can persist in seeing this, it's very difficult. Linux is like a delicate handicraft, not a massive object like Windows. And this is just the reason why it wins love of programmers. Please always remember it's a tool, not a lock. We learn Linux for better programming, not for showing off and putting it aside. I hope that by studying this tutorial, you can adjust your mindset, not only Linux, but also any problems encountered in learning.

### Combining practice with theory
It's not important to understand the tutorial, but to learn how to solve problems.

Before this tutorial, I had only been using Linux for a while and know some basic commands. But when I began to write 1.11 and the following chapters, I was sure that I learnt a lot while writing. For example, `MobaXterm` was recommended to me by the chairman of Intelligent Control Association (If it's a wrong name please tell me). `WSL` was explored by myself. You can hardly see it in almost any tutorial. And I can responsibly say that the tutorial I wrote is definitely much better than most of the video courses on `Bilibili`.

So what I want to say is that learning while operating is the **correct** study method. I can imagine that there will be many people who just watch videos or tutorials, and pass by without remembering or trying out the effects themselves. Let me put it in another way, do you know why the tutorial is in English?

### How to solve problems
I must point out what the 'problems' I said is. They are various unforeseen issues that arise during the process of following the tutorial (for me, they are during the process of writing the tutorial). **Never** think that tutorials are 100% applicable to everyone, even if I have identified various issues as much as possible. There always are more troubles waiting for you due to the different situations of each individuals.

In this way, I advise you to learn to use GitHub and other forums wisely.
You can see these two examples: [It should be running normally, but panicked](https://github.com/iffse/pay-respects/issues/34) and [Upgraded to current release, screen locker is broken](https://www.reddit.com/r/kde/comments/zlr6hb/upgraded_to_current_release_screen_locker_is/). Remember we are learners, not saints. It is normal to encounter setbacks in the study process. Learning to think is usually more effective than directly seeking help from others.

### Study is one's own business
Although saying this can easily undermine confidence, the fact is that study is on your own, instead of someone else's carrer. I guess you probably opened this tutorial voluntarily, not by force. So that you should stick to it and learn Linux by yourself. However, on the other hand, what you have learned has nothing to do with others. Of course, I have written so much in the hope that you can truly learn. As for how many people can persist, I will never know.

Apart from this tutorial, why not think about your course? How are you doing with your English, math, and major courses? What are your goals? Have you worked hard for them? I think these questions are worth your careful consideration. Please don't say 'it's too early to think about these things now', planning your studies and life is never too early. 

## We finally arrive at the final destination
Actually, writing this tutorial is largely due to Teacher Chen's request. I happen to be bored during the holidays, so I write a bit every day. And I find it quite interesting during this, killing two birds with one stone. At first, I planned to finish at 2.5, but as I researched with more and more things, I gradually reached 3.2. It took a month and about 11,000 words from start to finish. This should be the longest thing I have ever writtenÔºÅ

Well, there are still many areas that have not been covered in this tutorial, such as shell, and the basic commands are not explained in detail enough. For beginners, it should be sufficient, as many advanced uses still need to be explored by oneself. If you want to use Linux as a server, I think you can read some content about `Docker` and operations.

Let's end with a famous quote: *knowledge is boundless; there is no royal load for learning.*
