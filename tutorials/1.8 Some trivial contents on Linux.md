## Installing softwares
>[!IMPORTANT]
>It has differences between Debian and CentOS in this section!

Why Linux is hard to a newbie? I think it has a lot to do with the hassle of installing softwares. On Windows, users open Microsoft Store or Google Chrome, click "Download"  button and run the `.exe` at most. But it seems quite troublesome on Linux. Though many softwares provide `.deb` or other forms of installing packages on their website, most people ignore them. That's a pity.

But don't worry, we can still install using our terminal.

Next, I will take Debian as an example because CentOS has stopped maintenance and there may be unforeseen problems.

`apt(-get) [install | remove | search] <name>` helps install or uninstall softwares. Also it needs `root` permission so we  add `sudo` .

Some software dependency libraries have been updated, but the software dependency list has not been updated. Then you need to download a single package. Use `wget url`. I will provide a more detailed explanation in **1.9 Network commands on Linux**.

## Soft link
A soft link on Linux is like a shortcut on Windows.  Grammar here: `ln -s src dest`.

## date
`date` views system time. Grammar here: `date [-d]  [+format]`.

`-d` is used to calculate time, not very useful in my opinion.

Remember `+format` needs quotation marks when there is a space. Here's a form including all time formats:

| format |            meaning             |
| :----: | :----------------------------: |
|   %Y   |              year              |
|   %y   | the last 2 numbers of the year |
|   %m   |             month              |
|   %d   |              day               |
|   %H   |              hour              |
|   %M   |             minute             |
|   %S   |             second             |
