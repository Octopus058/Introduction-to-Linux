## First of all
**Before the beginning of this tutorial, you must see things below.**

☞ This tutorial took over 3 weeks to complete and has 10 thousand words. Don't study with a mentality of not seeking deep understanding.

☞ This tutorial takes `Debian 12` as most examples. Maybe there are examples of Ubuntu mixed in, because I have an existing Ubuntu virtual machine and I'm too lazy to install Debian anymore. They are the same in most cases.

☞ For the universality of the tutorial, the entire text is in English. Also, It WILL help your CET6.

☞ Learn to use search engines. You can learn on CSDN: https://www.csdn.net/, the biggest Linux forum: https://www.linux.org/ or any website you want.
☞ No one is a god. There must be many mistakes in the tutorial, tell me if you find them.

☞ Abandon Windows inertia thinking. Don't be afraid of terminal, GUI is not a must. 

☞ To follow Teacher Chen's advice, this tutorial starts from the basics, and doesn't involve any third-party software. It means what we only have is terminal (However I still state an ssh software in the extra sections).

## What is Linux
Quoted from https://www.linux.org/threads/what-is-linux.4106/
>Linux is an operating system that evolved from a kernel created by *Linus Torvalds* when he was a student at the University of Helsinki. It is an operating system means that it's meant to be used as an alternative to other operating systems, Windows, Mac OS, MS-DOS, Solaris and others.
>
>Today, Linux is enjoying a favorable press for the most part. This comes from the fact that Linux has proven to be a tremendously stable and versatile operating system, particularly as a network server. When Linux is deployed as a web server or in corporate networks, its down-time is almost negligible. There have been cases when Linux servers have been running for more than a year without re-booting and then only taken down for a brief period for routine maintenance. Its cost effectiveness has sold it more than anything else. Linux can be installed on a home PC as well as a network server for a fraction of the cost of other companies' software packages. More reliability and less cost - it's ideal.

## Why Linux
As a matter of fact, Linux is convenient, isn't it? And sometimes you know, there are lots of course designs that force you to use Linux to run programs which can have run on Windows. So, as a Windows user with 10+ years of experience, I (and also you) have to learn to use Linux instead.

Moreover, I know some of you will take part in competitions about robots, All of these test your Linux usage ability. For example, raspi, nano, they mainboards is controlled through Linux. Essential, right?

## Which Linux
![](/assets/Linux/1%20Hello%20Linux!/3.png)
There are always people debating which Linux distribution is better. Actually in my opinion most of them are similar, and the kernal commands are all the same.

For we newbies, I suggest Debian. `GNOME` desktop is beautiful and familiar to Windows users. And you can find tutorials easier than archlinux or RHEL when you get troubles.
>[!NOTE]
>Why not Ubuntu? Check **EX7 I'd rather be a bookworm**!

## At last
Rome is not built in a day, and Linux can't be learnt at once. It's like your school courses which needs to review and improve constantly. Maybe it's not useful at the moment, like calculus cannot be used to buy groceries either. It WILL make a huge impact one day. Now let's say the famous saying. *Talk is cheap, show me the code!*
