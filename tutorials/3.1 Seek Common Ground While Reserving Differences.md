Recently, I installed Windows + Debian dual OS. Debian `KDE` is much prettier as I said in **Hello Linux!**
> For we newbies, I suggest Debian. `KDE` desktop is beautiful and highly customizable.

## How to fall in love with Debian
>[!CAUTION]
> Install dual OS is **VERY** prone to make mistakes. Make sure to follow the tutorial and do not miss or skip any steps!

### Preparation
>[!IMPORTANT]
> This section assumes Windows 10/11 OS with GPT disk partition and UEFI BIOS mode.
> To check these, open `disk manager` and right click your disk to see if there is a `Transfer to MBR disk` option.

#### Make USB drive
Download `.iso` from USTC mirror: https://mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/. I supposed you to choose `KDE`.

Download `Rufus`: https://github.com/pbatard/rufus/releases/. This is almost the best tool to create bootable USB flash drives.

Prepare a USB disk bigger than 8GB and make sure there isn't any important data in it. Use `Rufus` to format and write it. Don't forget `GPT` disk partition.

Afterwards, you will obtain an installation USB drive.

#### Check settings
>![CAUTION]
> **DON'T SKIP THIS PART, IT'S VERY IMPORTANT!** You can check this video: https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Cc41127B9.

Close `bitlocker` in control panel.

Close `Nvidia GPU Direct` . That means choose `Optimus` in Nvidia control panel.

Close `Secure Boot` and `Intel RST` in BIOS. BIOS varies in different models of computers, please carefully search for these options.

#### Perform disk partition
Open `disk manager` to allocate a portion of the disk for Linux. If you have 2 hard drives, I recommend partitioning on the one without Windows C drive.
