## Achievement
Stop talking nonsense, let's start with the picture above.

This is a pretty good OS which can be normally used in daily life if there's no need for major games or professional softwares such as AutoCAD, Multisim or something else.

The software I use can be roughly divided into two categories: chat, tools and entertainment. The chat software mainly includes `QQ`, `Wechat`, `Teamspeak` and `Discord`. And tools like `GIMP`, `Kdenlive` and `WPS`. As for entertainment software, `Steam` and `Yesplaymusic` are the must.

## Some of my recommendations

### Nvidia driver
I don't know if you still remember the picture of Linus pointing his ðŸ–• vertically at Nvidia. You can still see it in the preface **Hello Linux!**

Actually this is not just a joke. Installing a Nvidia driver on Linux is quite hard for a newbie. I have reviewed many posts and blogs, and finally figured out what's going on.

Firstly I must say that you can find a lot of related content online. But they are a mix of good and bad, and many of them are outdated and not suitable for the current situation. So maybe it's a better idea to follow my steps.
>[!NOTE]
> I **DON'T** recommend downloading drivers from the `apt` source, as this doesn't seem to be applicable to the latest GPUs (such as 4060 laptop), and the [Debian Wiki](https://wiki.debian.org/NvidiaGraphicsDrivers) also has similar instructions:

- Remove all Nvidia packages. You can simply `sudo apt autoremove *nvidia*`.

- Download Nvidia driver from its website. Like this:

- Start installing it. `sudo bash <itsname>.run`. And you will meet some options. There are 2 which you need to pay attention to. Select **Yes** when it asks about **DKMS**. Select **No** when it asks about **X-config**.

>[!CAUTION]
> If you choose wrong options, it may lead to a result that you can't install Nvidia driver properly, even can't boot the desktop.

- The installation program should require a restart. Do it and type `nvidia-smi` to see whether you win the battle when your OS is reborn. It will be like this:

### Theme and window effect
Open your settings and find **Global Theme**. Choose a better theme for yourself, I personally like `Glassy`.

If you want to get the window effects I showed at the beginning of **3.1 Seek common ground while reserving differences**, find this two options in **Windows effects**.

### fcitx5 skins
Do you feel uncomfortable with the white and small UI of `fcitx5`? Don't worry. GitHub is a wonderful place that you can find almost whatever you want here. See this repository: https://github.com/thep0y/fcitx5-themes-candlelight.

The installation steps are clearly written in `README.md`, so they will not be repeated here.

Here's a demonstration of `winter`:

### latte
If you ask me what is the greatest software for Linux desktop beautification, I think I would say `latte`.

This is what `latte-dock` do. A fascinating applications dock.

And it's easy to install. You can make it in `apt` source.

Toggle your desktop shortcuts for applications onto `latte` works.

After installing `latte`, you can certainly place the taskbar at the top of the desktop, just like what I do.

### Wallpaper Engine for KDE
Yes, you read it right. KDE desktop supports `Wallpaper Engine`. But it's not as simple as launching `Steam` directly. You need to install a desktop wallpaper plugin to call it. Here's the url: https://github.com/catsout/wallpaper-engine-kde-plugin.

Do as `README.md` requires. But there's more you need to know.

- When you install dependencies, add `ninja-build`.

- Add `-b qt5` parameter to `git clone`. See this: https://github.com/catsout/wallpaper-engine-kde-plugin/issues/463.

Then download the plugin on the right side of the picture.

You need to install `Steam` and download (**NOT** run) `Wallpaper Engine`. Afterwards, switch to this desktop wallpaper plugin and set its path to `~/.local/share/Steam/`. Now you can choose wallpapers in your `Wallpaper Engine`.

### other softwares

#### VLC
As for me, `VLC` is the best media player on Linux, just like `Potplayer` on Windows. It can not only handle almost any media format but is also highly customizable. So why not?

#### stacer
Looks like a `Dism++` and `taskmgr` combination. You can check your system information, boot items and service, clean trash files and more.

#### Yesplaymusic
There's a good news that `Cloudmusic` has Linux version but also a bad one that it has been outdated since 2020. So I introduce `Yesplaymusic` as a replacement for `Cloudmusic`.

#### clash verge rev
To be frank, accessing GitHub and other foreign forums has always been a hassle. You have to surf the internet *scientifically*.

I guess you have heard about `Shadowsocks`, `V2ray` and `Clash`. In fact the original `Clash` has fallen and there's a resurrection version called `Clash verge rev`. Try it and you will find a familiar feeling like before.
