## Murmurs
I personally feel that compression and decompression related commands are one of the most troublesome contents in this tutorial. But we still have to overcome difficulties. There is a good news that this chapter is the end of the main part of the tutorial (but not the end of your Linux learning road :D). I know you must be tired but cheer up!

## tar
Before the commands, let's understand the types of compressed files on Linux first. `.zip` is the same as Windows, but not the most common. `.tar` and  `.tar.gz` are created by `tar` and `gzip`. **They are the most commonly used form.**

But wait, do you think of a question. Why Windows prefers `zip` but Linux not? Why not the two OSs unify compression format?

It's definately a good question. Linux allows `.zip` or `.7z` without problems. But they have a fatal disadvantage that they CANNOT storage Linux permission information (do you still remember it?). Therefore, `tar` is irreplaceable in a sense. Even the backend of `tar` can be changed to `zip` or `7z`, but they lose the battle with `tar` on Linux.

Now we can introduce our best friend `tar` formally. Strictly speaking `tar` isn't a kind of compression, it archives files in fact. `tar` puts files into a package without too much compression. The true implementation of compression or decompression is `gzip`. Moreover, `gzip` is also an compression algorithm. In other words, we call this the backend of `tar`.

>[!TIP]
>There are more algorithm except `gzip`, but it's commonly used.

Here's the grammar: `tar [-c | -v | -x | -f | -z | -C] <file1> <file2> ...`.

`-c` is compression. On the contrary `-x` is decompression.

`-v` shows the progress.

`-f` is followed by files, it's required in most cases.

`-z` opens `gzip` mode which means it will create `.tar.gz`.

`-C` changes the destination of decompression.

I recommend you to put `-z` at first (if there's `-z`) and `-f` at last to avoid errors.

I compressed 3 c++ files and  decompressed them into `~/decompression`. Don't forget to `mkdir` or it will throw error!

There is a tip in the figure above. `-zcvf` can be decompressed by `-xvf` and `-zxvf`, but `-cvf` can be only decompressed by `-xvf`. It's easy to make mistakes here. My suggestion is to compress everything in `gzip` format.

## More to say
I was planning to talk about `zip`. `zip` is more familiar to Windows users, but in order to avoid the bad habit of only using `zip`, I decided not to introduce it. If you have to use it, check this blog: https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_49114503/article/details/132812358. But  remember, `zip` isn't easier than `tar`.

After learning this chapter, you should know what it is. Don't ask similar silly questions again.
