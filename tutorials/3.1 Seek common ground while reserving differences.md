## Drunbing Time

Before this section I want to be a drunbee first. Tutorial is cheap, show me your screenshot.

Recently, I installed Windows + Debian dual OS. Debian `KDE` is much prettier as I said in **Hello Linux!**
> For we newbies, I suggest Debian. `KDE` desktop is beautiful and highly customizable. Here is a example:

## How to marry Debian
>[!CAUTION]
> Install dual OS is **VERY** prone to make mistakes. Make sure to follow the tutorial and do not miss or skip any steps! I strongly recommend those who are not confident to install under my supervision.

### Preparation
>[!IMPORTANT]
> This section assumes Windows 10/11 OS with GPT disk partition and UEFI BIOS mode.
> To check these, open `disk manager` and right click your disk to see if there is a `Transfer to MBR disk` option.

>And run `msinfo32` to check your BIOS mode

#### Make USB drive
Download `.iso` from USTC mirror: https://mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/. I supposed you to choose `KDE`.

Download `Rufus`: https://github.com/pbatard/rufus/releases/. This is almost the best tool to create bootable USB flash drives.

Prepare a USB disk bigger than 8GB and make sure there isn't any important data in it. Use `Rufus` to format and write it. Don't forget `GPT` disk partition.

Afterwards, you will obtain an installation USB drive.

#### Check settings
>[!CAUTION]
> **DON'T SKIP THIS PART, IT'S VERY IMPORTANT!** You can watch this video: https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Cc41127B9.

Close `bitlocker` in control panel.

Close `Nvidia GPU Direct` . That means choose `Optimus` in Nvidia control panel.

![](/assets/Linux/3.1%20Seek%20common%20ground%20while%20reserving%20differences/7.png)

Close `Secure Boot` and `Intel RST` in BIOS. BIOS varies in different models of computers, please carefully search for these options.

#### Perform disk partition
Open `disk manager` to allocate a portion of the disk for Linux. If you have 2 hard drives, I recommend partitioning on the one without Windows C drive.

I allocate 200GB for Debian.

We will do the remaining work when installing Debian.

### Install Debian
>[!IMPORTANT]
> This section is missing pictures. If there is a chance, it will be supplemented in the future.
Boot computer from USB disk. Then Choose **Install**.

The automatic installer for Debian is already comprehensive enough and generally does not encounter fatal errors. However, there are still some potential issues that may arise during the installation process. Here are what you should do:

- Skip DHCP configuration.

- Skip installing missing firmware.

- Skip `apt` source configuration. Do it after the installation is done.

- Please **strictly** follow the following steps for disk partitioning: Allocate space of the same size as RAM from the end of idle space for `swap` partitions first, then allocate all space for `/`,  don't forget that the file system is `ext4` format.

After all of these are completed, you should have finished installing Debian.

### Some important configurations

#### vim
When we finally touch this new OS, The first thing to do is to change `apt` sources. However, Debian doesn't pre-install `vim` so you have to install by yourself.

If you think you can easily handle the next steps, then you are completely wrong. When you type `sudo` terminal will throw an error:

![](/assets/Linux/3.1%20Seek%20common%20ground%20while%20reserving%20differences/9.png)

The solution is to  `su -` and  `vi /etc/sudoers` and find `root ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL`. Add your username behind it like this:

![](/assets/Linux/3.1%20Seek%20common%20ground%20while%20reserving%20differences/10.png)

Then install `vim`? No. The current `apt` source actually is a CDROM source and not the networked. So change it to USTC source with `vi`.

```

Afterwards, don't forget to update and upgrade.

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install vim
```

#### fcitx5
I know you must notice that Debian has no Chinese input method. Don't worry. You can use `fcitx5`. `Ctrl+space` shifts languages.

>[!TIP]
> Debian won't autostart fcitx5 so you need to set it manually.
> ![](/assets/Linux/3.1%20Seek%20common%20ground%20while%20reserving%20differences/11.png)

More than that, Recently I found that `fcitx5` has a bug that it can't be used in some softwares. You can check this blog: https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/15007602945.

Solution is to `sudo chmod 777 /usr/share/applications/<softwarenamne>.desktop` and right click it, then add this to its environment variables:

```
GTK_IM_MODULE=fcitx QT_IM_MODULE=fcitx QT_IM_MODULE=fcitx XMODIFIERS=@im=fcitx 
```

It is useful to `Wechat`, `Steam` and so on.


#### Debian with KDE desktop has a bug since 2019
If you install a new application now, It won't appear neither on desktop nor in applications launcher. Quite weird and it confused me for hours. Finally I found a blog posted from 2019 to solve it: https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/78349174?utm_psn=1872047636346957824. Simply saying, it means `mkdir -p ~/.local/share/applications/`.

Besides, I highly recommend you to `sudo apt install desktop-file-utils` to prevent some abnormal bugs.

#### Set shortcut keys for the terminal
Every time I want to open the terminal, I have to look for the `Konsole` application. Shortcut keys are better. I prefer `Ctrl+Alt+T`. You can set as your wish.
