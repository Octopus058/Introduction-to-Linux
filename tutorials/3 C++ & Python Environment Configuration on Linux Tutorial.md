## C++
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential
```
`build-essential` contains packages which C++ programs need such as `gcc`, `g++`, `cmake`, etc.

if you have edited a file `hello.cpp`, then you can compile and run it.
```
g++ hello.cpp -o hello
./hello
```
>[!IMPORTANT]  
>If you have problems when downloading dependencies of g++, check **10 Linux network commands** first then contact me.
## Python
>[!CAUTION]
>Don't use Python2, it has outdated!
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3
sudo apt install python3-pip
```
Remember, there are differences between Windows  and Linux. You need to input `python`, `pip3` instead of `python`, `pip`.
